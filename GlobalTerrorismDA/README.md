# Global Terrorism Data Visualization (GTDA)

This project involves visualizing attack locations of the five most active groups on a world map using Python. The visualization is created with geopandas for geospatial data handling, matplotlib for plotting, and contextily for adding basemaps.

## Project Structure

- `GTDA.ipynb`: Python script for loading data, creating visualizations, and saving the output.
- `data/`: Directory containing data files (e.g., shapefiles and CSV files with location and attack data).
- `img/`: Directory for saving generated images from the visualization script.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `geopandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `contextily`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install geopandas matplotlib pandas contextily
```

or


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project focuses on data analytics using both R and Python to perform data processing, analysis, and visualization for different cases. The objective is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them in a comprehensive manner. The project covers multiple stages including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and visualization.

## Requirements

### Python Packages

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter

### R Packages

- tidyverse
- ggplot2
- dplyr
- tidyr
- caret

To install the required Python packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install the required R packages, you can use the following commands in an R environment:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "caret"))
```

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asan1900/Data-Analytics.git
cd data-analytics-project
```

Ensure you have the necessary Python and R environments set up.

## Usage

### Python

You can run Python notebooks or scripts by navigating to the `notebooks/Python/` or `src/Python/` directory and executing the files.

Example:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Python/data_analysis.ipynb
```

### R

R scripts and notebooks are located in the `notebooks/R/` and `src/R/` directories.

Example:

```r
# In R console
source('src/R/data_cleaning.R')
```

## Data Sources

This project uses datasets from the following sources:

1. [Source 1](https://example.com)
2. [Source 2](https://example.com)

Please ensure that you have the necessary access to these datasets before running the project.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Remove inconsistencies and prepare data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand data distributions and relationships.
- **Statistical Modeling:** Build predictive models to extract insights.
- **Visualization:** Create comprehensive visualizations to present findings.

## Contributing

# Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project focuses on data analytics using both R and Python to perform data processing, analysis, and visualization for different cases. The objective is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them in a comprehensive manner. The project covers multiple stages including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and visualization.
